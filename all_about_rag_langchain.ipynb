born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.\\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]\\nIn 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. A little over 1,000 people were killed, according to official records, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[11] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised, Modi\\'s administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the 2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.\\nModi\\'s administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[14][15] and the deaths of six Indian personnel to friendly fire was later revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal.[16] Modi\\'s party comfortably won the 2019 general election which followed.[17] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian-administred portion of the disputed Kashmir region,[18][19] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs,[20][21][22] sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi administration.[23][24] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India\\'s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 4.7 million Indians died, according to the World Health Organization\\'s estimates.[25][26]\\nUnder Modi\\'s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[27][28][g] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[34][35][36] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.\\u20091915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[43][b][44]\\nAccording to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father\\'s tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway station,[45] but the evidence of his neighbours does not entirely corroborate this statement.[46][47] During a protest against the government, his brother, Prahlad Modi, contradicted that he ever sold tea. According to him, his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big mistake by calling the Prime Minister a \"chai wala\" (tea seller).[48]\\nModi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[49] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[50][51]\\nWhen Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[52] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP\\'s Gujarat unit.[53]\\nIn a custom traditional to Narendra Modi\\'s caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[54][55] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[56] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[55] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[57] The marriage was unconsummated and Modi kept it secret because he would not have been able to become a pracharak in the puritanical RSS.[58][59]\\nModi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[60] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked the required college education.[61] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi\\'s life.[62]\\nIn mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[63][64] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle\\'s canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[65]\\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[66][67][68] Modi\\'s first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[69][70] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[71][72][73] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle\\'s employ and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[74] working under Inamdar.[75] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[75] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[72][i]\\nIn 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[78] at the Delhi University.[58][79] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[80][81] as an external distance learning student.[82] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[83][84][j]\\n\\nEarly political career\\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[88][89] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[90] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[91] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[92][93] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[94] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the Emergency.[95][96] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[97]\\nModi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS\\'s history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP\\'s campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi\\'s planning was responsible for the win.[98][99] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi\\'s work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP\\'s Gujarat unit later in 1987.[100]\\n\\nModi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in c.\\u20092001\\nModi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani\\'s Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi\\'s 1991–1992 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[49][101][102] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[102] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi\\'s electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[103][104] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[105] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[49] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[106] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[107]\\n\\nChief Minister of Gujarat\\nTaking office\\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel\\'s health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel\\'s standing had been damaged by his administration\\'s handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[106][108][109] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel\\'s administration, was chosen as a replacement.[49] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi\\'s lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel\\'s deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[110] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[111] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[112]\\n\\n2002 Gujarat riots\\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat riots\\nOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[k][115] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[116][117] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[8][116][118] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike) across the state.[119][120] Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[116][119][120] The government\\'s decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[116][121] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[117] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[116][115][122] the vast majority of them Muslims.[115] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[123] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[7][124]\\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[8][125] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[126] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[7][127][128] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[119][120] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.[8] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[129] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[130] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[7][118][131] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[132][133][134] According to Martha Nussbaum, \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\".[7]\\nModi\\'s personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\".[7] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[135] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[126][136][137] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi\\'s complicity in the killings.[136] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[136][138] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT\\'s position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[139][140] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate\\'s court. The SIT examined Ramachandran\\'s report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate\\'s court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT\\'s finding there was no evidence against Modi.[141] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[142][143][144]\\n\\nLater terms as Chief Minister\\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\\nFollowing the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[145] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[146] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[147] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[148] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[149][150][151][152] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[147] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[6][149] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[148] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[6][149] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[153] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[154]\\nDuring Modi\\'s second term, the government\\'s rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat\\'s economic development.[108][6][149] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[155] When the BKS staged a farmers\\' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS\\'s eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[155][156] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[157][158]\\nModi\\'s relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP\\'s electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[159][160] Western nations also raised questions about Modi\\'s relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country\\'s Commission on International Religious Freedom,[161][162] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[161] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[163] and the EU[164] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[165][166]\\n\\nModi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004\\nDuring the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[167] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[168] In 2007, Modi wrote Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[169][170] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[171] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[172] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[173] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year\\'s election.[174]\\nDespite the BJP\\'s shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi\\'s campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[149] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[149] Modi\\'s 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[149] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[149] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[147] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[175] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[176] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[177]\\n\\nDevelopment projects\\nThe Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase\\nAs chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi\\'s policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20\\xa0trillion or US$250\\xa0billion in 2023) were signed.[108]\\nThe governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[178] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[179] As a result, the state\\'s production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[178] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[180] led to Gujarat\\'s agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[181] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.[178] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[182]\\nThe Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[183] Modi significantly changed the state\\'s system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[178] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[184]\\n\\nDevelopment debate\\nModi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012\\nA contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat\\'s economic development during Modi\\'s tenure as chief minister.[185] The state\\'s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, a rate similar to those of other highly industrialised states, and above that of India as a whole.[182] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office; some scholars have stated growth did not much accelerate during his tenure.[186] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank\\'s \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[187] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens\\' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country\\'s 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\".[182][188] In the later years of Modi\\'s government, Gujarat\\'s economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[6] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi\\'s policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[149]\\nDespite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi\\'s tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[189][190] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[191]\\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[130] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[130] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[130] The state government\\'s social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[130] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013, the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[10] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[130]\\n\\nAllegations of bribery\\nDuring its raids in 2013 and 2014, the CBI seized some diaries from two big Indian companies, Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group. These diaries contained references of alleged payments made to leaders belonging to as many as 18 political parties including BJP, Congress, JDU, BJD etc.[192][193] Among these were some entries mentioning \"Gujarat CM\" and \"Ahmadabad Modiji\".[194][195][193] Citing these entries, on 21 December 2016, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Modi received cash bribes worth ₹65 crore from Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.[196][197] In November 2016, advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India asking for investigation of the alleged bribe payments made to some senior public servants including Modi.[198][199] A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra dismissed the plea in January 2017 stating that the evidence provided was insufficient.[200][201] Later on, Justice Mishra was criticised by a section of advocates and activists for siding with the Modi government in multiple judgements during his tenure at the Supreme Court.[202][203] The Wire questioned the manner in which the Supreme Court buried the Sahara-Birla diaries\\' investigation.[204]\\n\\nPremiership campaigns\\n2014 Indian general election\\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election\\nNarendra Modi hands over his resignation as Maninagar MLA to the Speaker of the Gujarat Vidhan Sabha.\\nExternal videos BJP announces Shri Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate for Loksabha Elections. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 13 September 2013\\nIn September 2013, Modi was named the BJP\\'s candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[205][206] Several BJP leaders,[207] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\", expressed opposition to Modi\\'s candidature.[208] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP\\'s 2009 general election campaign.[209][210] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[205][211][212] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[207][213] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[185]\\n\\nModi meets his mother after winning the 2014 Indian general election\\nDuring the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[207] He projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development\" without focusing on specific policies.[207] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi\\'s commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[210] Prior to the election, Modi\\'s media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi\\'s neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[210] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[158] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[214][207][211][39] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[214] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP\\'s election manifesto.[39]\\nThe BJP\\'s campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[190] Modi\\'s campaign blitz cost around ₹50 billion (US$630\\xa0million)[185] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[215] In addition to more-conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media[185][207] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[39]\\nThe BJP won 31 percent of the vote,[38] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[210][211] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP\\'s success.[211][207] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 percent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[211] The magnitude of the BJP\\'s victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[39][185][211][216][217] Modi\\'s tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[218]\\nModi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[219] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[220] India\\'s president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[221][222] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[223]\\n\\n2019 Indian general election\\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election\\nExternal videos BJP announced manifesto and Shri Narendra Modi as prime minister candidate. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 8 April 2019.\\nOn 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[224] The BJP\\'s chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party\\'s Main Bhi Chowkidar (\"I too am a watchman\") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC\\'s campaign slogan Chowkidar Chor Hai (\"The watchman is a thief\").[225] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[226]\\nAmit Shah launched the BJP\\'s election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[227] Modi\\'s campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[17][228] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[229]\\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[230][231] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[232] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[233][234]\\n\\nPrime Minister\\nMain article: Premiership of Narendra Modi\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India, with President Pranab Mukherjee administering the oath\\nModi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India for the second time, with President Ram Nath Kovind administering the oath\\nAfter the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister (PM) of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country\\'s independence from the British Empire in 1947.[235] Modi\\'s second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA\\'s 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.[236]\\n\\nGovernance and other initiatives\\nPrime Minister Modi walking towards the dais to address the Nation at Red Fort, on the occasion of 75th Independence Day, in Delhi on 15 August 2021\\nModi\\'s first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[158][237] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[238] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[38] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[239][240] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[238][239][240][241][242] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[240]\\nIn its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[158][241] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[158][243] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[158][238]\\nModi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[244][245][246] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[247][248]\\nIn 2019, a law to reserve 10 percent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[249][250] In 2016, Modi\\'s administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[251] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[252]\\nSince May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[253] Narendra Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[254]\\n\\nHindutva\\nFurther information: Hindutva\\nModi pays obeisance at Tirumala Temple in Andhra Pradesh.\\nThe activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi\\'s appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government\\'s support.[255][256] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\" and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[257][258] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[214]\\nLinks between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP\\'s electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[259] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[39] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao\\'s credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[39][260][261] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[262] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[262][263]\\nIn 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[264][265] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[266][267][268] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[262][268][269] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[270][271] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[272][273][274][275][276] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0\\xa0ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[277] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[278]\\nSoon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[262] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[279][280][281] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[262][282] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[283] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[284][285][286][287] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[262]\\n\\nEconomy\\nBRICS leaders in 2019. Left to right: Xi (China), Putin (Russia), Bolsonaro (Brazil), Modi and Ramaphosa (South Africa)\\nThe Modi government\\'s economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[241][288] Modi liberalised India\\'s foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[241][289][290] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[288] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[291] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country\\'s largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.[288] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[241]\\nThe funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi\\'s administration.[158] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 percent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 percent during Modi\\'s first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 percent.[241] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[241] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[292] During Modi\\'s first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent.[293][294][295] The percentage of the budget spent on children\\'s nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[296] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 percent in 2023.[297]\\nIn September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[241][298] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[241] Modi\\'s administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[299] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[238] Modi\\'s government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[300]\\n\\nModi at the launch of the Make in India programme\\nIn his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[301] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[302] The move led to severe cash shortages,[303][304][305] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[306] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[307] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one percent of the country\\'s GDP was wiped out.[308] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[309][310] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 percent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[311][312]\\nDuring the first eight years of Modi\\'s premiership, India\\'s GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5% percent compared tho the rate of 7.03 percent under the previous government.[313] Income inequality increased.[314] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[315][316] GDP growth was 6.12 percent in the 2018–19 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 percent.[317] In the year 2019–20, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 percent, while inflation increased to 4.7 percent.[318] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 percent the following financial year.[319]\\n\\nHealth and sanitation\\nSee also: Swachh Bharat Mission\\nIn his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government\\'s healthcare spending.[191] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government\\'s spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[320] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 percent less funding[321][322] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[323] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[324] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of ₹20 billion (US$250\\xa0million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[325]\\n\\nModi discussing the COVID-19 pandemic with Chief Ministers via videoconferencing in June 2020\\nModi emphasised his government\\'s efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[320] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The campaign\\'s stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[326][327] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[328][329][330] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[331] and planned to construct 60\\xa0million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[327][328][329] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government\\'s targets.[332] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[333]\\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[334][335] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[336] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[337] and followed with a three-week \"total lockdown\" two days later.[338][339] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[336][340][341] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[342] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[343] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[344][345] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[346] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021—almost 10 times the Indian government\\'s estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO\\'s estimate.[25][26] India\\'s death toll was thus the highest worldwide, accounting for more than 20% of all Covid deaths.[347]\\n\\nForeign policy\\nFurther information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and trips as prime minister\\nModi with U.S. President Donald Trump at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India\\nForeign policy played a small role in Modi\\'s election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP\\'s election manifesto.[348] Modi\\'s foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[348] Modi continued Manmohan Singh\\'s policy of \"multi-alignment\".[348] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[l]\\n\\nModi meeting Myanmar\\'s leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018\\nIndia\\'s relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[350] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi\\'s premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[161][162] Sensing Modi\\'s victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater rapprochement from the West. Following Modi\\'s 2014 appointment as India\\'s PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[351] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[352][353]\\n\\nModi with Australian PM Anthony Albanese during the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event.\\nDuring the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[348] One of Modi\\'s first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[354] Modi also made several visits to the US;[355] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US\\'s earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[355]\\nIn 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[238] Modi\\'s administration brought renewed attention to India\\'s \"Look East Policy\", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[356] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India\\'s historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[356] China–India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China–India skirmishes.[357] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan\\'s highest civilian honour in 2016.[358][359] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin.[360][361][362]\\nIn March 2023, Modi excercised Cricket Diplomacy by hosting his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese for a Friendship through Cricket event to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties at the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. [363]\\n\\nG20 Presidency\\nIndia hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[364] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries\\' evolving agenda under India\\'s presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring  through the G20\\'s Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[365][366][367]\\nNews sources CNN, Reuters and the Washington Post reported that in the lead up to the G20 meeting, the Indian authorities, including the Archaeological Survey of India embarked on a mass demolition drive against homeless shelters and slum neighborhoods across New Delhi resulting in the eviction of its marginalized residents[368][369][370] The Indian government\\'s press agency Press Information Bureau  rejected the claims, and said that they were done as per the Supreme court of India orders and not linked to the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.[371]\\n\\nDefence\\nBenjamin Netanyahu, at the time Prime Minister of Israel, and Modi visiting the Technology Exhibition, at Tel Aviv, Israel in 2017\\nIndia\\'s nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[372] During Modi\\'s tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[373][374] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[373][375][374]\\nModi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[376][377][378] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[379][380][381] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[382] Subsequent reports said India\\'s statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[376][383][384] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; no targets of significance were hit.[385][386] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[387][388][389] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[390]\\n\\nPM Modi along with Quad leaders in Washington\\nIn May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in an aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[391] In 2020, skirmishes between the nations led to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides.[392] A series of talks between India and China were held, using military and diplomatic means for peace.[393] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[394] Modi has been criticised for maintaining silence over ceding about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[395][396][397]\\nIn December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[398] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[399] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[398][400] The Indian government\\'s Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[401][402] including some from neighbouring countries.[403]\\n\\nEnvironment\\nModi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.\\nWhile naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change\", and more-than-halved its money allocation in his administration\\'s first budget.[404] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[241] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[405] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India\\'s most-polluted areas.[405] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[406]\\nSpeaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, \"Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.\"[407] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[408][409] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[410][411] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[412] Holding developed countries responsible,[413] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[414] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[415] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[416] It has achieved 10 percent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[417]\\n\\nDemocratic backsliding\\nUnder Modi\\'s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[g] According to one study, \"The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists\".[30][418] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[419][31] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development.

He previously represented the constituency of Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. He is a member of the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was the party president from December 2017 to July 2019. He is the chairperson of the Indian Youth Congress, the National Students Union of India and a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. He is the son of the former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi.\\nBorn in New Delhi, Gandhi spent his early childhood between Delhi and Dehradun and stayed away from the public sphere for much of his childhood and early youth. He received primary education in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School in Dehradun. However, due to security concerns, he was later homeschooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at St. Stephen\\'s College before moving to Harvard University. The following year, due to security threats following the assassination of his father, he moved to Rollins College in Florida, completing his degree in 1994. The next year, he obtained his M.Phil. from Cambridge. After completing his post-graduation, he initiated his professional career with the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services Private Ltd, a technology outsourcing firm based in Mumbai.\\nIn 2004, Gandhi announced his entrance to politics and successfully contested the general elections held that year from Amethi, a seat that was earlier held by his father; he won again from the constituency in 2009 and 2014. Amidst calls from Congress party veterans for his greater involvement in party politics and national government, he was elected Congress vice-president in 2013, having served as the general secretary previously. He led the Congress\\' campaign in the 2014 Indian general elections; the party suffered its worst electoral result in its history, winning only 44 seats compared to 206 seats won previously in the 2009 general election. In 2017, he succeeded his mother as Congress party leader and led the party into the 2019 Indian general election. The party won 52 seats, failing to get 10% of the seats needed to claim the post of leader of the opposition. After this poor performance in the election, he resigned as party leader and was succeeded by his mother, Sonia Gandhi, on an interim basis.\\n\\n\\nEarly life and background\\nFurther information: Nehru–Gandhi family\\nGandhi along with Sonia Gandhi,then POI Pratibha Patil, then VPOI Ansari, then PM at the memorial of his grandmother Indira Gandhi\\nGandhi was born in Delhi on 19 June 1970,[10] as the first of the two children of Rajiv Gandhi, who later became the prime minister of India, and Italian-born Sonia Gandhi (née Maino), who later became the president of Indian National Congress, and as the grandson of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. His paternal grandfather Feroze Gandhi was a Parsi from Gujarat.[11] He is also the great-grandson of India\\'s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Priyanka Vadra is his younger sister and Robert Vadra is his brother-in-law.[12]\\nGandhi attended St. Columba\\'s School, Delhi[13] before entering the elite all-boys\\' boarding The Doon School in Dehradun (also the alma mater of his father, Rajiv Gandhi) from 1981 to 1983. At Doon, Gandhi\\'s contemporaries were the former Congress, now-BJP politicians Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada.[14] Meanwhile, his father joined politics and became the prime minister on 31 October 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Due to the security threats faced by Indira Gandhi\\'s family from Sikh extremists, Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka, were home-schooled thereafter.[15]\\nGandhi joined St. Stephen\\'s College, Delhi (an affiliated college of the University of Delhi), in 1989 for his undergraduate education but moved to Harvard University after he completed the first year examinations.[16] In 1991, after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers (LTTE)[17] during an election rally, he shifted to Rollins College in Florida, USA, supposedly due to security concerns and obtained his B.A. in 1994.[18] During his time at Rollins, he assumed the pseudonym Raul Vinci and his identity was known only to the university officials and security agencies.[16][19] He further went on to obtain an Master of Philosophy (MPhil) from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995.[20]\\nBefore joining politics, Gandhi, worked at the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm, in London for three years.[21] In 2002, Gandhi returned to India and set up his technology consultancy viz. Backops Services Private Ltd in Mumbai, where he was one of the directors of the firm.[22] He then opened BackOps UK, a firm which used to acquire defence contracts from foreign companies that supplied to the Indian armed forces.[23]\\n\\nPolitical career\\nFormative years\\nGandhi (right) with Hillary Clinton, Sonia Gandhi and Karan Singh in New Delhi, 2009\\nIn March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the 14th general elections from his father\\'s former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha, which is India\\'s lower house of Parliament.[24] His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighboring constituency of Raebareli.  When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators who had perceived his sister Priyanka Gandhi as the more charismatic and probable successor. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India\\'s most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party\\'s political fortunes among India\\'s youthful population[25] In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as an uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions.[24]\\nAfter being out of power for a record eight years, the Congress party returned to power winning a total of 145 seats, in the 2004 Indian general election. A coalition government was formed at the center by Congress with the backing of regional parties. Gandhi secured a victory by a substantial margin of over 100,000 votes, thereby maintaining the stronghold of his family in Uttar Pradesh.[26] However, the party performed poorly in Uttar Pradesh, as it held only 10 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, with a vote share of 12.53 per cent.[27]  He did not hold any official role or position within the government.[28] From 2004 to 2006, Gandhi served as a member for the Standing Committee on Home Affairs. Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resource Development.[29]\\nGandhi and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi managed their mother\\'s campaign for re-election to Raebareilly in 2006, which was won with a victory margin of over 400,000 votes.[30] He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election; Congress, however, did not perform well in those elections winning only 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53% of votes.[31] On 24 September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as the General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee, which is the governing body of the Congress party. This appointment was part of a reshuffle of the party secretariat.[32] In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.[33]\\n\\nYouth politics\\nIn September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation and the National Students Union of India (NSUI) the faction that caters to the student community.[34] As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations. Under him, the IYC and NSUI have seen a dramatic increase in members from 200,000 to 2.5 million.[35] Indian Youth Congress (IYC) underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive.[36][37] In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people who will make up the think-tank of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC).[38] In 2009, during Gandhi\\'s visit to West Bengal, the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members.[39] Similarly, the IYC was only able to acquire around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh. However, after Gandhi\\'s visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions.[40]\\nWhile serving as the general secretary of the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played an active role in strengthening the organisation and increasing student participation in politics.[36] Under his leadership, the NSUI initiated programs and campaigns to address issues affecting the student community, such as the quality of education, employment opportunities, and social justice.[41][42][43] Gandhi also advocated for greater student representation in decision-making processes and supported student leaders in their endeavours.[44]\\n\\nGeneral election (2009 and 2014)\\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh sits next to Gandhi who leads a delegation of leaders from Bundelkhand region in New Delhi. 2009\\nElection Commission of India announced the 14th General Elections which was held in five phases between 16 April 2009 and 13 May 2009 to elect the members of the 15th Lok Sabha. Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107 constituencies.[45][46] His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party\\'s vision and agenda for the country.[47] He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women\\'s empowerment. Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country\\'s future.[48]\\nThe nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent Congress-led UPA government.[49]\\nHowever, the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties.[50] Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes.[51] Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats.[52][53]\\nGandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi,[54] and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress.[55] Gandhi held the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP\\'s Smriti Irani, by a reduced margin of 107,000 votes.[53][56] Under his leadership, the Indian National Congress suffered its worst-ever performance in elections and won only 44 seats compared to 206 seats won previously in the 2009 general election.[57][58] The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won only 59 seats compared to 262 seats won previously in the 2009 general election.[58][59][60] After the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign his posts, only to be rejected by the party\\'s working committee.[61]\\n\\n2012 Assembly elections\\nGandhi campaigned during the 2012 Assembly elections in the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh election for almost two months, holding 200 rallies. However, Congress ranked as the fourth party in the state, winning 28 seats, an increase of six seats from the previous 2007 elections. Out of the 15 seats in the Amethi parliamentary constituency, Congress won two.[62][63]\\nCongress activists defended the result in Uttar Pradesh, saying \"there\\'s a big difference between state elections and national polls and in the end, there is only the first family, a hope and a prayer\",[64] and pointing out the turn around attributed to Gandhi in the 2009 Lok Sabha national elections in the state. However, Gandhi publicly accepted responsibility for the result in an interview after the result was declared.[65]\\nIn the Gujarat assembly elections held later in the year, Gandhi was not made the head of the election campaign. This was seen and regarded by opponents as an admission of defeat and was termed as a tactic to avoid the blame of defeat.[66][67][68] Congress won 57 seats in the assembly of 182, which was 2 less than the previous elections in 2007. Later in bypolls, Congress lost 4 more seats to BJP.[69]\\n\\nNational Herald corruption case\\nIn the National Herald corruption case, the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi, and five others which included Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, and Satyan Pitroda in December 2015,[70] and ordered them to appear in person before the trial court on 9 December.[71] In 2016, Gandhi was granted an exemption by the Supreme Court of India in 2016.\\nIn December 2020, the Delhi court dismissed a petition filed by then BJP leader Subramanian Swamy seeking to summon Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, and others as accused in the case. The court held that there was no prima facie evidence to suggest their involvement in any corruption conspiracy. The Congress party, raised objections to the complaint filed by Subramanian Swamy, labelling it as “politically motivated”.[72]\\n\\nGeneral election (2019)\\nGandhi speaking to a rally in Karnataka\\nGandhi speaks at a press conference after the announcement of results of 2019 Indian general election, as seen from The Ridge, Shimla\\nGandhi used the slogan \"Chowkidar Chor Hai\" as a jibe against Narendra Modi, BJP\\'s Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2019 Indian general election.[73][74] The slogan was aimed at Modi about the alleged irregularities and favoritism in awarding the contracts for the Rafale fighter jet deal.[75][76] The said case was considered by the Supreme Court of India and after carefully going through all the evidence, the high court dismissed the case and exonerated the current government of India.[77]\\nGandhi led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress party. Under his leadership, the party improved its seat count from 44 out of 543 in 2014 to 52 out of 542 in 2019. It also boosted its vote from 19.3% to 19.5% in 2019. The Indian National Congress won 52 seats, failing to get 10% of the seats needed to claim the post of Leader of Opposition. After this poor performance in the election, Gandhi resigned as party leader and was succeeded by his mother, Sonia Gandhi. Gandhi contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from two constituencies, Amethi, Uttar Pradesh[78] and Wayanad, Kerala.[79] Gandhi won the Wayanad seat in the 2019 general elections with over 60 percent vote share.[80] However, he lost his existing seat of Amethi to Smriti Irani of the BJP by a margin of 55,120 votes.[81]\\n\\nBharat Jodo Yatra (2022–2023)\\nMain article: Bharat Jodo Yatra\\nFurther information: Timeline of Bharat Jodo Yatra\\nGandhi interacting with people during Bharat Jodo Yatra\\nBharat Jodo Yatra, literally a ‘unite India march’ was started by Gandhi on 7 September 2022 at Kanyakumari after paying tributes to his late father Rajiv Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. Congress said the yatra was \"India\\'s biggest mass contact program\", during which the concerns of the people will reach Delhi.[82] After unfurling the tricolour flag at the Srinagar\\'s historic Lal Chowk, which marked the end of 137-day-long foot march covered 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) in nearly five months across 12 states and two union territories.[83][84] Gandhi said that the Bharat Jodo Yatra has given an alternative vision of the politics to the country. Gandhi unfurled Tiranga at the historic clock tower and sang the Jana Gana Mana to send a strong message of nationalism.[85] During the march, the INC elected a new party president and also won a majority in the 2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, its first majority it won by itself since 2018.\\n\\n2023 conviction\\nMain article: Disqualification of Rahul Gandhi\\nOn 23 March 2023, Gandhi was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment by a court in Surat, Gujarat, under charges of defamation related to remarks he had made against Narendra Modi during the 2019 Indian general election campaign.[3][86] The case was filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Purnesh Modi who alleged he had defamed everyone who held the surname Modi. The judgement passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate H. H.Verma held Gandhi to be guilty and stated that the entire \"Modi community\" was defamed when he had asked \"Why do all these thieves have the name Modi?\" during a speech comparing Narendra Modi with economic offenders such as Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi.[86] Legal experts have questioned the basis of the charge as defamation is only actionable against individuals and not a generic class of people.[3]\\nGandhi\\'s lawyers have stated that they would appeal at a higher court and have secured a one-month stay on the sentence.[87] The conviction\\'s coming into force would disqualify him from holding any public office and make him ineligible to contest in the upcoming 2024 Indian general election.[3][88]\\nOn 24 March, a notification was issued from the Lok Sabha Secretariat and affirmed by the speaker Om Birla which disqualified Gandhi as a member of Parliament effective 23 March, amidst differing views among legal experts on whether a stay on sentencing and conviction should lead to immediate disqualification.[89][90]\\nOn 4 August, Gandhi\\'s conviction was stayed by the Supreme Court of India pending appeal.[91]\\n\\nElectoral performance\\n\\n\\nYear\\n\\nElection\\n\\nParty\\n\\nConstituency Name\\n\\nResult\\n\\nVotes gained\\n\\nVote share%\\n\\n\\n2004\\n\\n14th Lok Sabha\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian National Congress\\xa0\\n\\nAmethi\\n\\nWon\\n\\n390,179\\n\\n66.18%\\n\\n\\n2009\\n\\n15th Lok Sabha\\n\\nWon\\n\\n464,195\\n\\n71.78%\\n\\n\\n2014\\n\\n16th Lok Sabha\\n\\nWon\\n\\n408,651\\n\\n46.71%\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n17th Lok Sabha\\n\\nLost\\n\\n413,394\\n\\n43.86%\\n\\n\\nWayanad\\n\\nWon\\n\\n706,367\\n\\n64.67%\\n\\nPositions held\\nPublic offices\\nGandhi has held the following positions;[92]\\n\\n\\n\\nYear\\n\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n2004\\n\\nElected to 14th Lok Sabha\\nMember, Standing Committee on Home Affairs (2004–06)\\nMember, Standing Committee on Human Resource Development (2006–09)\\n\\n\\n2009\\n\\nElected to 15th Lok Sabha (2nd term)\\nMember, Standing Committee on Human Resource Development\\nMember, Consultative Committee on Rural Development\\n\\n\\n2014\\n\\nElected to 16th Lok Sabha (3rd term)\\nMember, Standing Committee on External Affairs\\nMember, Consultative Committee on Ministry of Finance and Corporate Affairs\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\nElected to 17th Lok Sabha (4th term)\\nMember, Standing Committee on Defence\\nMember, Consultative Committee, Ministry of External Affairs\\n\\nWithin party\\n\\n\\nYear\\n\\nPosition\\n\\nPreceded by\\n\\nSucceeded by\\n\\n\\n2007 - 2013\\n\\nGeneral secretary of INC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2007 - Incumbent (as of 2020)\\n\\nChairperson of Indian Youth Congress\\n\\nPosition established\\n\\nIncumbent (as of 2020)\\n\\n\\n2007 - Incumbent (as of 2020)\\n\\nChairperson of NSUI\\n\\nPosition established\\n\\nIncumbent (as of 2020)\\n\\n\\n2013 - 2016\\n\\nVice president of INC\\n\\nPosition established\\n\\nPosition abolished\\n\\n\\n2017 - 2019\\n\\nPresident of INC\\n\\nSonia Gandhi\\n\\nSonia Gandhi (interim)\\n\\nPolitical and social views\\nNational security\\n68th United States Secretary of State John Kerry  with Gandhi at the Roosevelt House in New Delhi.\\nIn December 2010 during the United States diplomatic cables leak, WikiLeaks leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009, where the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Gandhi, then the General Secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the United States Ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer. In a \"candid conversation\" with Roemer, he said that he believes Hindu extremists pose a greater threat to his country than Muslim militants. Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the Bharatiya Janata Party. Also responding to the ambassador\\'s query about the activities in the region by the Islamist militant organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India\\'s indigenous Muslim population.[93] In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticized Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, \"In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in Pakistan, and also some segments of the Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India\\'s fight against terror as also our strategic security. \"Adding that terrorism has no religion, he said that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India.[94] Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the RSS and has compared them to terrorist organizations like SIMI.[95][96]Gandhi with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou in Chanakyapuri, New DelhiAfter the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, at a Madhya Pradesh election rally in Indore, Gandhi claimed that a police officer told him that Pakistan\\'s ISI was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters.[97][98] However, the district administration, the UP state government, the Union Home Ministry, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development.[99][100] This remark drew heavy criticism from various political outfits such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U).[101] Congress\\'s Jairam Ramesh said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for this remark.[102] In reply to the ECI\\'s show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn\\'t intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics.[103]\\nThe BJP also asked the government to explain why Gandhi, who holds no post in the government, is being briefed by intelligence officers on important security issues.[104] On 13 November 2013, the Election Commission of India found Gandhi\\'s explanation to be insufficient conveyed its displeasure and advised him to be more circumspect in his public utterances during election campaigns.[105]\\n\\nLokpal\\nGandhi opines that the Lokpal should be made a constitutional body and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He opined that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption, rather a strong political will is needed to remove corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of Anna Hazare\\'s fast. Gandhi\\'s statement was considered a delaying tactic by the opposition and Team Anna\\'s members. It was consequently slammed by opposition leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.[106] The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the Jan Lokpal Bill report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal be made into a constitutional body.\\n\\nFarmers\\' and Land Agitation\\nOn 19 April 2015 Gandhi addressed the farmer and worker\\'s rally, named as Kisan Khet Mazdoor Rally in Ramlila Maidan. Here he made \"references to his agitations in Niyamgiri in Orissa and Bhatta-Parsaul in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh\".[107] The rally was attended by 1 lakh people. In the speech he gave, he criticized the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi about his comment in Toronto where he said that he was \"cleaning the mess created by previous governments\".[108] He also said \"Do you know how Modi won the election?.. He borrowed thousands of crores from industrialists for his several campaigns and advertisements. How will he pay them back? He will pay them back with your land. He will give your land to his industrialist friends.\"[107]\\nHe razzed the government as a \"suit-boot government\", a reference to Modi\\'s monogrammed suit which he wore in the Republic Day meeting with Barack Obama. Moreover, he used the \"acche din government\" jibe (which was Modi\\'s election campaign slogan meaning \"good days government\") and mentioned that it had \"failed the country\".[109]\\nA land bill was introduced by the BJP government in the parliament in May which was criticized by the opposition parties.[110] Accusing the government of \"murdering\" UPA\\'s land bill,[111] Gandhi promised to prevent the bill from being passed, if not in the parliament then would \"stop you [ BJP government] on streets\". He further accused the government of diluting the bill and called it \"anti-farmer\".[110] Gandhi also drew a parallel between \"daylight robbery\" and the bill.[112] On 26 May, the day of the Modi government\\'s first anniversary, Gandhi commented at a rally in Kozhikode \"Unfortunately, birthday celebrations is only for a few powerful friends of the government. Kisan, farmers and mazdoor have nothing to celebrate.\" [113]\\n\\nWomen\\'s empowerment and LGBTQ rights\\nGandhi as the Chief Guest at The Doon School Model United Nations in 2017.\\nGandhi has spoken publicly about the importance of women\\'s empowerment and gender equality in India.[114][115] For instance, he has called for increased representation of women in politics and for the eradication of gender-based violence.[116][117][118] Under second Manmohan Singh ministry, Women\\'s Reservation Bill which would allow 33 per cent reservation of all Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats for women, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha.   \\nGandhi backed the Women\\'s Reservation Bill stating, \"Women do not need any protection. If you give them their rights, they can protect themselves\".[119] This bill was passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010, stating that the reservation would no longer be in effect after 15 years from its implementation. To become a law, the Lok Sabha needed to pass the bill and it had to be ratified by at least half of India\\'s legislative assemblies. The bill, however, never went to a vote in the Lok Sabha and eventually lapsed due to its pending status.[120][121][122][123] In 2019, while addressing students in Chennai, Gandhi has again called for 33 per cent reservation of all parliamentary Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats for women, as well as government jobs.[124]\\nOn 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India revoked Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, an act which criminalized homosexual sex between adults. Gandhi had backed the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and the decriminalization of homosexuality, stating that he believed that issues related to personal freedom should be left to the individual.[125]\\n\\nClimate Change\\nGandhi has been very concerned about the environmental degradation of the world and has said that unless they are not made a political issue, they won\\'t get the attention they deserve.[126][127]\\nGandhi criticized Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) 2020 draft by calling it \"dangerous\" and said that its long term consequences will be harmful. Calling it a disaster, he said that it will silence the communities who will get directly impacted by environmental degradation.[128][129]\\n\\nEconomic Issues\\nGandhi while addressing All India Congress Committee (AICC) in Jaipur, called for an end to red tape and outdated laws that slow job creation.[130]\\nGandhi views the economic policies of Modi Government as fundamentally to benefit the 2-3 billionaires and has described them as crony capitalists.[131] Calling the \"crony capitalists\" as best friends of Modi,[132] he has been critical of the privatization of government assets.[133] He is of the view that RSS and crony capitalists are colluding to control India.[134] He has been specifically harsh on Indian Billionaire Gautam Adani and said that Modi Government has been very favourable towards Adani.[135][136][137] He sees the rise of Adani as a direct consequence of crony capitalism.[138][139] He said that he is not anti-business and supports fairness.[140] Disagreeing with privatization of PSUs, he said that Congress will not allow the privatization if it comes to power.[141][142][143] Citing the report on inequality by Oxfam, he said that rising economic inequality is the result of Modi Government\\'s economic policies.[144][145][146]\\n\\nDemonetization\\nGandhi has been very critical of the Modi government\\'s demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series.[147] He has called it a \"tragedy\" and a \"disaster\" that has negatively impacted the Indian economy and the lives of ordinary citizens. Gandhi has also accused the government of carrying out the policy without adequate planning and causing immense hardship to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. He said that demonetization is a fundamental failure of policy design[148] and has alleged that it was a deliberate move by \"PayPM\" to help 2-3 billionaires to monopolize the economy. Terming demonetisation as the country\\'s “biggest scam”,[149]\\nDuring his public speeches and political rallies, Gandhi has consistently criticized the demonetization move, claiming that it failed to achieve its intended objectives of combating black money and curbing corruption.[150] He has also argued that the policy was implemented without proper consultation with experts or the opposition parties. Gandhi further asserted that, demonetization caused significant disruption to farmers, and rendered millions jobless in small and medium-sized businesses, and workers in the informal sector.[151][152]\\n\\nSee also\\nNational Students\\' Union of India\\nIndian Youth Congress\\nList of presidents of the Indian National Congress\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ \"Rahul Gandhi returns to parliament after Indian court suspends defamation conviction\".

Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\",[a] he has appeared in more than 90 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\\nKhan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Hindi films.\\nAs of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as \"Brand SRK\" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan\\'s philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO\\'s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children\\'s education and the World Economic Forum\\'s Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women\\'s and children\\'s rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers\\' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\\n\\n\\nEarly life and family\\nParents\\nShah Rukh Khan\\'s father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[1][2] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[3] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[4] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[c]  According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[7][4][8] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[4][9] As of 2010, Khan\\'s paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar\\'s Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[4]\\nIn 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[10] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[11] Khan\\'s mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[12][c][13] His parents were married in 1959.[14]\\n\\nEarly life\\nKhan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[15] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[16][17][d] Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\".[19]\\nKhan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[20] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[21] Khan attended St. Columba\\'s School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[22] and received the school\\'s highest award, the Sword of Honour.[21] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[23] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[24] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[25] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor\\'s degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi\\'s Theatre Action Group (TAG),[26] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[27][28] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master\\'s degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[29] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[30]\\nHis father died of cancer in 1981,[e] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[33] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[34] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[31][35] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[36]\\n\\nActing career\\nSee also: Shah Rukh Khan filmography\\n1988–1992: Television and film debut\\nKhan\\'s first starring role was in Lekh Tandon\\'s television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[37] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[38][39] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza\\'s television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul\\'s miniseries Idiot (1992).[40] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[40] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[41] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[42] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[40][43]\\nKhan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[44] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother\\'s death.[45] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films.[44] His first offer was for Hema Malini\\'s directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[30][38] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[46] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[47] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan\\'s Bollywood career;[48] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[49] Also released in 1992 were Khan\\'s first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[50] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was \"sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy\\xa0... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.\"[51]\\n\\n1993–1994: Anti-hero\\nAmong his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[52] Baazigar, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[53] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\".[54] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[55] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\".[55] Darr marked the first of Khan\\'s many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan\\'s stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences.[56] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\".[57] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[58] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[59] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[60]\\nIn 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah\\'s comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan\\'s best performance, calling him \"spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart\".[61] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit.[55] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man\\'s career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking \"insane risks\" and \"pushing the envelope\" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career.[51] The director Mukul S. Anand called him \"the new face of the industry\" at the time.[45]\\n\\n1995–1998: Romantic roles\\nKhan with co-star Kajol in 2014 celebrating 1000 weeks continuous showing of their film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\\nKhan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan\\'s melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[62] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra\\'s directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol\\'s character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\".[63] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year\\'s highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India,[62][64] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[65][66] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015.[67][68] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan\\'s Best Actor Awards.[55] The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He\\'s cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\"[69]\\nIn 1996, all four of Khan\\'s releases failed critically and commercially,[70] but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza\\'s romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[58] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai\\'s diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[71] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.[72] Khan\\'s final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[55]\\nKhan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt\\'s action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar\\'s production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received,[73] but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance.[74] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[75] the third instalment of Mani Ratnam\\'s trilogy of terror films.[76][77] In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar\\'s romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a \"pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.\"[78] Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year,[55] although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[79]\\nThe roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers,[80] and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[81][82] He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.[83] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars,[81] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.[84]\\n\\n1999–2003: Career fluctuations\\nKhan in 2000\\nKhan\\'s only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,[85] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi.[58] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited.[86] The company\\'s first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[87] It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[88] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan\\'s predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it\\'s high time he innovated his act a little.\"[89] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan\\'s Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan.[90] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan.[91][92] On Khan\\'s performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\"[90]\\nIn 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan\\'s historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,[93] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[94] As losses continued to mount for the production company,[88] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[95] In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi\\'s Shakti: The Power.[96] He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.[96][97] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London.[98][99][100] Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.[97]\\n\\nKhan with co-star Aishwarya Rai at the home video launch of their film Devdas (2002)\\nSuccesses during this time included Aditya Chopra\\'s Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar\\'s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[87][101] which Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[102] Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men.[103][104] Khan\\'s performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[58][105] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.[106]\\nIn 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali\\'s period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time,[107] and became a box office success, earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35\\xa0million) worldwide.[108] The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan,[49] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[109] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year.[101][110] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences.[111] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza\\'s Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film\\'s success.[112]\\n\\n2004–2009: Comeback\\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer.[113] In the company\\'s first production, he starred in Farah Khan\\'s directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain.[114] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra\\'s romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.[115] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).[106][116]\\n\\nKhan with Priyanka Chopra at the premiere for Don in 2006\\nIn his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker\\'s social drama Swades (meaning \"Homeland\"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[117] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of \"Bollywoodised realism\", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[118] In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film.[119] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan\\'s performance \"unsettling\" as \"a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants\",[120] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date.[121][122] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades.[49][58] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood\\'s \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[123]\\nIn 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar\\'s fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India\\'s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards.[124] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India\\'s highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[101] earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide.[106] Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,[125] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[126][127]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn\\'t have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there\\'s this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that\\xa0... I\\'ll do it, I am an actor. But I can\\'t start believing in this myth.\"\\n\\n\\n\\xa0—Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry\\'s top star[128]\\n\\n\\nIn 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the Indian women\\'s national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films\\' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university\\'s hockey team,[129] essentially portrayed himself as a \"cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim\".[130] Faring well in both India and abroad,[106][131] Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[49] which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been \"without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks\", portraying Kabir Khan \"like a real flesh-and-blood human being\".[132] Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".[133] In the same year, Khan starred\\nalongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan\\'s reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad.[101][134] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare.[135] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, \"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent\".[136]\\nKhan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been \"tailor-made\" for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents,[137] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj.[138] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz\\'s Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[139][140] He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone.[141] As head of the film\\'s production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word \"barber\" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.[142]\\n\\n2010–2014: My Name Is Khan and expansion to action and comedy\\nKhan with director Karan Johar and co-star Kajol at an event for My Name Is Khan in 2010\\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle\\'s Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol.[143] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country\\'s president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[144] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition.[145][146] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India,[106][101] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,[49] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar.[147] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger\\'s sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society\\'s gold seal of approval\".[148]\\nIn 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha\\'s superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children.[149] The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood\\'s most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$26.78 million).[150][151] Despite negative media coverage of the film\\'s box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million).[152][153] The film, and Khan\\'s portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar.[154] Khan\\'s second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006).[155] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself.[156] His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, \"Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts\".[157] The year\\'s highest grossing Bollywood production abroad,[158][159] it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[160]\\n\\nKhan at an event for Chennai Express in 2013\\nKhan\\'s only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra\\'s last picture,[161] the romantic drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan\\'s first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one.[84][162] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide.[163][164] The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[165] At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra\\'s other past heroines.[166]\\nIn 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[167] The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for \"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book\".[168] Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket sales.[169][170] On International Women\\'s Day in 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success.[171] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan\\'s ensemble action comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.[172] Although Khan\\'s unidimensional character was criticised,[173] the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million) worldwide.[174][175][176]\\n\\n2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus\\nKhan in 2017\\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty\\'s action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million).[177] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[178] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma\\'s action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer.[179] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film\\'s non-conformity to mainstream formula.[180] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde\\'s coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[181]\\nIn Rahul Dholakia\\'s action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan\\'s performance to be \"inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms\".[182] Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide.[183][184] Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali\\'s Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan\\'s pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed \"similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age\".[185] He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai\\'s romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle.[186][187] The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan\\'s performance.[188][189] Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his \"dominating performance and tremendous energy\" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an \"excellent fit\" for the role for allowing his \"naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight\".[190][191] Both Jab Harry Met Sejal and Zero were box office flops.[192][193]\\nAccording to a Box Office India report, Khan\\'s stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.[194] Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback.[195] During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva, Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, and Laal Singh Chaddha.[196]\\n\\n2023: Resurgence\\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Deepika Padukone in Yash Raj Films\\' action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India.[197] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan\\'s \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star.[198][199] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan\\'s stardom.[200][201] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee\\'s Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[202] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan\\'s screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\".[203] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[204] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$130\\xa0million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema\\'s second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[205] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[206]\\nIn his third release of 2023, Khan will star in Rajkumar Hirani\\'s Dunki, a social drama about illegal immigration, particularly Donkey flight.[207]\\n\\nOther work\\nFilm production and television hosting\\nKhan at the 61st Filmfare Awards in 2016, which he hosted along with Kapil Sharma\\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[86] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[113] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising.[208] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films.[209] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film\\'s characters.[210][211] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012).[212] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.[213]\\nIn addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards.[214][215][216] In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,[217] and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[218] In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV\\'s Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[219] Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star.[219] In 2017, Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.[220]\\n\\nStage performances\\nKhan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle\\'s Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert.[221] The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year.[222][223] In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester\\'s Old Trafford and London\\'s Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000\\xa0people.[224] Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[225] The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150\\xa0years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.[226]\\nKhan started an association with the \"Temptations\" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22\\xa0venues across the world.[227] The show played to 15,000\\xa0spectators at Dubai\\'s Festival City Arena.[228] In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands.[229] Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta,[230] and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney.[231] In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London,[232] and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.[233]\\n\\nOwnership of IPL cricket team\\nIn 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09\\xa0million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).[234] As of 2009[update], KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1\\xa0million.[235] The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years.[236] Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012[236] and repeated the feat in 2014.[237] The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[238]\\nKhan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs.[239] He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull.[240] In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians.[241] Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being \"manhandled\" by the security staff[241][242] and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour,[243] he had been abused with communal indecent comment.[242] Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity.[242][244][245] Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials\\' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him.[242] Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match.[246] MCA revoked the ban in 2015[247] and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no \\'cognisable offence\\' was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.[244][245]\\n\\nIn the media\\nMain article: Shah Rukh Khan in the media\\nKhan at a Tag Heuer press conference in 2012\\nKhan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as \"King Khan\", \"The Baadshah of Bollywood\", or \"The King of Bollywood\".[a] Anupama Chopra cites him as an \"ever present celebrity\", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities.[253] He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion.[254] Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him \"the world\\'s biggest movie star\".[255][256] In 2011 he was described as \"the biggest movie star you\\'ve never heard of...perhaps the world\\'s biggest movie star, period\" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times[f][258] and has been called the world\\'s biggest movie star in other international media outlets.[b] According to a popularity survey, 3.2\\xa0billion people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise.[262] In a 2022 readers\\' poll by Empire magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the \"outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft. Comfortable in almost every genre going, there\\'s pretty much nothing he can\\'t do.\"[263] In 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world,[264] and he topped the list per a readers poll.[265]\\nKhan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the Forbes India\\'s \"Celebrity 100 list\" in 2012, 2013 and 2015.[266][267][268] His wealth has been estimated at US$400–600\\xa0million.[269][270] Khan owns several properties in India and abroad, including a £20\\xa0million apartment in London,[271] and a villa on the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai.[272]\\nKhan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on The Times of India\\'s list of the 50 most desirable men in India,[273][274] and in a 2007 poll by the magazine Eastern Eye he was named the sexiest man in Asia.[275] Khan is often referred to as \"Brand SRK\" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures.[276][277] He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market.[278][279] Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D\\'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer.[279][280] Books have been published about him,[281][282] and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005),[283] and the Discovery Travel & Living channel\\'s ten-part miniseries Living with a Superstar—Shah Rukh Khan (2010).[278] In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London\\'s Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan.[284][285] Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds\\' museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.[286]\\nKhan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including Pulse Polio and the National AIDS Control Organisation.[280] He is a member of the board of directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in India,[287] and in 2011 he was appointed by UNOPS as the first global ambassador of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.[288] He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health and proper nutrition, and joined India\\'s Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign.[289] In 2011, he received UNESCO\\'s Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade.[290] In 2014, Khan became the ambassador for Interpol\\'s campaign \"Turn Back Crime\".[291] In 2015, Khan received a privileged degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.[292] In 2018, Khan was honoured by the World Economic Forum with their annual Crystal Award for his leadership in championing children\\'s and women\\'s rights in India.[293][294]\\nIn April 2020, Khan announced a series of initiatives to help the government of India and the state governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Delhi mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic as well as relief measures for thousands of underprivileged people and daily wage labourers affected by the lockdown.[295][296] He offered his 4-storey personal office space to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to be used as a quarantine centre for coronavirus patients.[297]\\n\\nAwards and recognitions\\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Shah Rukh Khan\\nKhan is one of the most decorated Bollywood actors.[49] He has received 14\\xa0Filmfare Awards from 30\\xa0nominations and special awards,[298][g] including winning eight for Best Actor; he is tied for the most in this category with Dilip Kumar.[147] Khan has won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performances in Baazigar (1993), Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Devdas (2002), Swades (2004), Chak De!

His children follow both religions; at his home the Qur\\'an is situated next to the murti of Hindu deities.[318]\\nAlthough Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the initialism SRK.[319]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nBollywood portal\\nKhans of Bollywood\\nList of awards and nominations received by Shah Rukh Khan\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\n^ a b Attributed to multiple sources[248][249][250][251][252]\\n\\n^ a b Attributed to multiple sources[258][259][248][260][261][262]\\n\\n^ a b Although Shahrukh Khan\\'s mother was reported to be the adopted daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan, a major general in the Indian National Army, the Indian Army denied those reports.[5] According to Khan, his father was related to Shah Nawaz.[6]\\n\\n^ There was some confusion because Khan seemingly contradicted himself in an interview, saying that he was born and brought up in Mangalore[18] but he later confirmed his birthplace as Delhi, and that he was brought up in Mangalore for the first five years.[17]\\n\\n^ Chopra\\'s 2007 book gave the date as 19 September 1980,[31] but in an interview in 2014 Khan said the date was 19 October 1981.[32]\\n\\n^ Although Khan has an estimated worldwide fan base exceeding one billion, the bulk of his fan base, like numerous other Bollywood stars, is in Asia and Indian diaspora communities worldwide, whereas Zeitchik was writing for an American audience in the Los Angeles Times.[257]\\n\\n^ Awards in certain categories come without a prior nomination.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Kool, Vinod K.; Agrawal, Rita (2020).
